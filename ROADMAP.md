Fake News Detector Roadmap
==========================

This document gives an idea of the next steps for the Fake News Detector extension, just to give a little guidance on where we should focus our efforts.

### Short Term

- Small changes to make the extension usable and start marketing it to get early feedback ([extension#8](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/8), [extension#1](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/1))
- Allow users to check text for WhatsApp rumors ([api#17](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/17))
- Sign in with Facebook to prevent cheating ([extension#4](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/4), [api#4](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/4))
- Have a backoffice area where journalists and other experts can help classify with safety most popular news ([api#18](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/18))

### Medium Term

- Try to gather the most data as possible (by convincing a lot of people to use the extension and classify)
- Have a mobile app so users can also use the Fake News Detector on mobile (which is the main way people consume news nowadays) by pasting the link on the app
- Use the good amount to data to improve Robinho with new algorithms, maybe try deep learning

### Long Term

- Publicize it to journalists, fact checking websites and other important vehicles
- Keep working on Robinho to improve the accuracy as most as possible
- Integrate with other tools, such as tracemap, hoaxanalyser, e-farsas, etc to give users better and more detailed results ([api#10](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/10))

### Maybe Someday

- Allow to submit images pieces to analyze, since not always rumors are in links or text (there are a lot which are images or videos)

## Done

- Add internationalization to also publish it outside Brazil ([extension#2](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/2))
- Add page scrapping to save more data and use it for improving classification later ([api#2](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/2))
- Allow to use the extension across all web (not only facebook) ([extension#7](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/7),  [extension#5](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/extension/issues/7))
- Add pre-categorized domains
([api#5](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/5))
- Add caching, ddos protection from cloudflare ([api#7](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/api/issues/7))
- Allow users to check for urls from the website (https://fakenewsdetector.org/)
