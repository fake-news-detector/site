## What is this?

The Fake News Detector is an extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fake-news-detector/alomdfnfpbaagehmdokilpbjcjhacabk)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fakenews-detector/)
that allows you to detect and flag news directly from your Facebook into
**Legitimate**, **Fake News**, **Click Bait**, **Extremely Biased**, **Satire** or **Not news**.

After flagging a newstory, other people that have the extension will be able to see your flagging,
will pay more attention to it and may also flag. The data is then saved on a database and read by our robot,
[Robinho](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/robinho).

Robinho reads the information given by us humans and learn with time to automatically flag
news as Fake News, Click Bait, etc, based on its text. By doing that, even fresh news that no
one saw may be quickly flagged.

The extension then show on your facebook the opinion from other people and from the robot:

The more you flag the news, more you contribute to building a database to better teach Robinho,
which is still in very early development, look, he is still a baby robot:

## Motivation

In 2016, during United States election, a lot of fake news websites were created,
and shared through social media, specially Facebook. They were so much, that
Fake News had
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/accordingtomatthew/2016/12/fake-news-stories-received-more-clicks-than-real-news-during-end-of-2016-election-season/">
more clicks than the real ones.
</a>

One of the most iconic cases were from a citzen from Macedonia who had
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/">over 100 fake news websites</a>,
and earned thousands of dollars with advertising.

Most of those websites were pro-Trump, why? Was the macedonian a true Trump defender?
Not necessarily! But he noticed that Trump voters were more likely to believe
and propagate Fake News.

Now, in 2018, we will have elections in Brazil, and there are many pages out there
that do not bother to check the sources and can take advantage (some already are)
of the same strategy that benefited Donald Trump.

In addition, we also have lots of extremely biased posts from all sides and the
annoying click-baits.

The Fake News Detector is a small initiative to try to make some difference in the
fight against this problem, joining people's goodwill (Crowdsourcing) with
technology (Machine Learning)

## How to contribute

Just by downloading the extension and flagging the news you will already be
helping a lot! Both other users and in the development of Robinho.

But if you are a programmer or data scientist, the Fake News Detector is an open
source project that needs a lot of your help! All repositories are available at:
[https://github.com/fake-news-detector](https://github.com/fake-news-detector).

The technologies are also very exciting: we use Elm with WebExtensions for the
extension, Rust for the API and Python for Machine Learning. Not an expert?
Not a problem, after all the goal of the project is precisely to learn these
technologies while helping the world.

If you want to help, take a look at our [ROADMAP](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/site/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)
to understand where the project is going, also check out the
[issues on github](https://github.com/fake-news-detector).

If you are interested but have questions about how you can help, send me a tweet,
